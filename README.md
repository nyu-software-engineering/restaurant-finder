# Restaurant Finder

## A new Restaurant app for the Ages
 - we are concerned with implementing the overall functionality of Finding Restaurant based on different constraints including but not limited to Location, Price and Cuisine Type. ]
 - Additional features could include Randomly generating compatible restaurants and a Social Network for sharing cuisines, ratings, coupons, deals and recommendations with friends.
 - This app is for People and a Time crunch for a bite to eat. People can get a restaurant they know they'll like before they even read the reviews.
